In this machine learning project our dataset which has been derived from the famous MNIST dataset consists of 784 data fields which contain pixel values from 0-255 inclusive and a target field "label".Thus in our data set, each image is a handwritten digit converted to greyscale image which is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total given as pixel values from 0-783. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. The taget field contains the digit in the handwritten image.

This repository contains two files: 

  1. The first one is a tutorial notebook explaining how PCA works and its effects on the dataset.
     You can visit "https://www.kaggle.com/sidagar/pca-explained-with-visuals" to view the notebook.

  2. In the second one I have implemented a KNN model over PCA.(Score obtained was 0.968). 
     You can visit "https://www.kaggle.com/sidagar/digit-recogniser-using-pca-and-knn" to view the notebook.

    PS:There are interactive and dynamic plotly charts in the files(not visible in the viewer on git.)

    Please download and run the same on your jupyter notebook to view the same.You can also visit the kaggle websiste links mentioned to view the charts.

My Kaggle username is "sidagar" without quotes.
